A comprehensive analysis and optimization tool for Yoneâ€™s item builds in League of Legends. This repository uses a Weighted Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach to calculate the most effective item builds at full inventory, considering Yone's unique kit and various game-state assumptions.

Features:
Mathematical Modeling: Implements character power value (CPV) formulas to assess the impact of various stats like attack speed, critical strike chance, and defensive attributes.
Item Build Optimization: Generates item builds based on stat weight analysis and statistical modeling.
Heatmap Analysis: Visualizes stat importance using random sampling and correlation matrices (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall).
Comparative Analysis: Benchmarks generated builds against reference builds from high-level players and community tools (e.g., Coachless and WayOfTheTempest).
